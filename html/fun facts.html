  <h3 style="color:rgb(102, 18, 53)">Who I Am</h3>

  <p style="color:rgb(102, 18, 53); style="font-size: 60px;> Marketing was the dreamâ€”imagining myself deep in the world of catchy campaigns and funky logos.
   But life has a funny way of throwing curveballs, and mine was a dive into IT and application development.
   What started as a detour turned into a journey I didn't see coming, but now wouldn't change for the world.
  Turns out, the jump into the tech side wasn't a step away from creativity but a dive into a different kind. 
  Designing websites and logos, I'm blending what I love about marketing with the new skills I've picked up along the way. 
  Each project is like a puzzle, where I get to mix art and strategy, making something both beautiful and smart.
 Away from the screen, I'm probably in the kitchen, baking away, or planning my next trip! 
 Baking relaxes me, and traveling opens my eyes to new designs and stories. And of course speniding time with my family, 
 they're the ones who keep me together and remind me of the joys outside school and work. 
 IT wasn't the first plan, but I'm finding my way in it, mixing bits of my marketing knoweledge with the tech world's endless opportunities.

    <h3 style="color:rgb(102, 18, 53)">Who I Want To Be </h3>
  
    <p style="color:rgb(102, 18, 53)"> The thought of navigating the constantly evolving tech industry can sometimes be intimidating. 
      Yet, with each step forward towards my goals, I find myself gaining not just confidence but also excitement for what lies ahead.
       This journey is a testament to my determination to grow stronger and more resilient with each challenge faced.
      My ambition is to build a life that not only fulfills me but also fills me with joy when reflecting on my achievements.
      My aspirations are diverse and deeply rooted in both my professional and personal interests.
       I am committed to creating impactful work that resonates with users, with practicality. 
      I want to look back on my career and life knowing I didn't just go through the motions; 
      I lived passionately and made the most of every opportunity that came my way.
